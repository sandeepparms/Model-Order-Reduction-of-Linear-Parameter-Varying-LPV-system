In many engineering problems, a control engineer has to deal with a very large model with a huge number of states. This model is input for designing a controller. Two standard
control design techniques, H1 and LQG result in a high order controller that is at least as complicated as the plant. This introduces undesired complexity in designing, analysis, and
synthesis of the controller. In almost in all practical applications, control engineer seeks a simpler solution. Model order reduction for linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems
is crucial in order to extend the applicability of the LPV framework to a wider range of applications. In this project work, a comparison of variants of the balanced truncation
method for LPV systems is carried out. The notion of an internally balanced realization is discussed. Detailed theory and computational procedure from Woodâ€™s thesis (see literature) for arriving at the balanced truncation are discussed. To demonstrate the practicality
of the discussed methods, a chained mass-spring-damper system is chosen and several LPV system formulations are made. The consequence of bounding the rate of parameter
variation results in the complexity of the balanced system by introducing an exclusive dependency on the rate bound. Several combinations of mass-spring-damper system with
different numbers of scheduling parameters are presented. The resulting balanced and truncated models are compared and discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of the
LMI based approach are demonstrated.
